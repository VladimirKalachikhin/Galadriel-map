GaladrielMap get position and velosity from gpsd via _askGPSD.php_ service. You may configure _askGPSD.php_ to you gpsd host and port. Default are localhost and 2947 port (default for gpsd).<br>
How to install and configure gpsd see [gpsd pages](http://www.catb.org/gpsd/).

## Tracks
You may use gpxlogger app from gpsd-clients packet to logging track on your server. GaladrielMap displaying current track as not well-formed gpx file. Other tracks may be diplayed simultaneously.<br>
Run _chkGPXfiles.php_ in cli to repair non well-formed gpx files for other applications.
